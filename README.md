This repository contains what I call "template activities" for the app [J-K Bike - Technical Disaster Prevention](https://www.jan-exner.de/software/android/jkbikemdp) and the associated [web site](https://jkbike.net/mdp/).

You can find the app on [my web site](https://www.jan-exner.de/software/android/jkbikemdp) and on sources on [github](https://github.com/janexner/JKBikeMechanicalDisasterPrevention).

The purpose of this repository is to host those templates in different languages. The app will download the corresponding language the user is using on their phone, or fall back to English if there is no match.

Currently, there are translations for French and German (and a regional variant for German-speaking Switzerland).

If you know your way around bike terms, know a language other than English, and want to contribute, please see the CONTRIBUTING file.
