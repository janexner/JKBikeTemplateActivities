Do you know your way around bikes and bike parts? Do you speak/read/write a language that is not yet covered in this repository? We would welcome your help!

Each language is represented as a folder in this repository. The folder name is usually the two-letter language code ("en", "fr", "de", ...), or a combination of language and region ("de-rCH").

# How to contribute

The first step is for you to fork this repository.

In your fork, you can make changes, commit those changes, and then create a pull request so that we can incorporate those changes.

# Fix language in existing files

If you want to fix existing language, start with forking the repository, then navigate to the folder for the language that you want to fix.

Open the `template-activities.json` file in said folder and make your changes. You can do this directly on github, or you can clone _your_ fork of the repository and use an editor on your local machine.

# Add a new language

If you would like to add a new language, start with forking the repository, then add a folder for the language you want to add.

I would suggest you then copy `template-activity.json` from a language that you know into your new folder, then change the `title` and `description` fields to your language.

# Pull request

Once you are done with your changes, commit them and create a pull request. That can be done fairly easily on github.
